<b>Project Name:</b> Signal - a live bushfire reporting app<br>

<b>Team Name:</b> LitSquad (NSW)<br>

<b>Challenge:</b> Engaging communities in hazard reporting & safety [(Challenge Link)](https://hackerspace.govhack.org/challenges/engaging_communities_in_hazard_reporting_safety)

# Our Solution

The Signal app allows the NSW Fire department to get live data about areas affected by the bushfires by allowing Australians to quickly and easily report if there is a fire in their area.<br>

The app allows users in hazard prone areas to submit a report if there is a bushfire in their location. 
This report is then approved by the NSW Rural Fire Service and is used to help support an emergency response. 

Signal also creates a way for the RFS to communicate with the community, providing a community forum under each verified bushfire report.<br>

# Why it’s important

As a result of the 2019/2020 BushFires, at least 33 people have been killed (including four firefighters) and more than 11 million hectares of bush, forest and parks across Australia have burned.<br>

Bushfire incidents were recorded by monitoring high risk areas with helicopters, with a minimum of 1hr lag when it comes to displaying that information which has greatly impacted the RFS ability to respond effectively.<br>

The importance of current and reliable information is paramount when it comes to emergency situations. Thus, the app would play a key role in improving the RFS's information procurement processes.<br>

The Signal app can:

* __Drastically improves emergency responce times__
* __Create a quick and reliable source of incident reporting for the NSW Fire department__ 
* __Allow effective communication between the community and the RFS to help them take action to better respond to future bushfires__
* __Drastically reduce cost for RFS to retreive information about bushfire incidents__

We strongly believe the signal app will greatly contribute to the Rural Fire Service's mission to reduce the likelihood and consequence of fires occurring in Australia.
