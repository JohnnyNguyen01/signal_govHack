<b>Project Name:</b> Signal - a live bushfire reporting app<br>

<b>Team Name:</b> LitSquad (NSW)<br>

<b>Challenge:</b> Engaging communities in hazard reporting & safety (Challenge)<br>


# Our Solution

The Signal app allows the NSW Fire department to get live data about areas affected by the bushfires by allowing Australians to quickly and easily report if there is a fire in their area.

The app allows users in hazard prone areas to submit a report if there is a bushfire in their location. This report is then approved by the NSW Rural Fire Service and is used to help support an emergency response. Signal also creates a way for the RFS to communicate with the community, providing a community forum under each verified bushfire report.



# Why it’s important

The Rural Fire Service has a problem receiving live data about bushfire incidents. <br>
As a result of the 2019/2020 BushFires, at least 33 people have been killed (including four firefighters) and more than 11 million hectares of bush, forest and parks across Australia have burned.

Bushfire incidents were recorded by monitoring high risk areas with helicopters, with a minimum of 1hr lag when it comes to displaying that information which has greatly impacted the RFS ability to respond effectively.

The Signal app can drastically cut down on this processing time, create a quick and reliable source of incident reporting for the NSW Fire department as well as effectively communicate with the community and help them take action to better respond to future bushfires.
